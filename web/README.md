============

### Goal

Build your first Couchbase Web app in just a few minutes! Take an existing Web application
and add data persistence along with offline support!

# ![Application Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mini-hacks/master/kitchen-sync/topology.png "Typical Couchbase Mobile Architecture")

### Setup

 - Clone this repo, or download the .zip folder.
 - Open it in your favorite editor ([Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) is perfect for that)

 	In this tutorial, we learn how to use Materialize, a material-design UI, Import.IO and
 	Couchbase to read offline news articles from the Growth Hackers website and synchronise likes across all the connected devices. Articles are storing on the cloud in Sync Gateway at 
 	`http://localhost:4984/growthhackers`
