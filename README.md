## Setting up the dev environment for Android

This only applies to attendees who feel comfortable building the Android app. 

Before attending the workshop, be sure to do those 3 things:

* Download the latest version of Android Studio available [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* Install it and download extra packages as per [this guide](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio)
* Open this app in Android Studio by choosing the **Select File > Import Project** menu and select build.gradle located in the android folder. Run the app, you should see this screen:

And you're set!

You can open a github [issue](https://github.com/jamiltz/GrowthHackersReader/issues) if you are having trouble setting things up.

For those totally new to Android development, there will be an option to follow the same steps with HTML/CSS/JS. No need to prepare for that.
